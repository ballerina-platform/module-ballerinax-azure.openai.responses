## Overview

[Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/) provides access to OpenAI's powerful language models including GPT-4o, GPT-4, and o-series models through Microsoft Azure's enterprise-grade infrastructure. It combines OpenAI's advanced AI capabilities with Azure's security, compliance, and regional availability features.

This package offers functionality to connect and interact with the [Responses API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/aifoundry/) of the Azure AI Foundry Models Service. The Responses API is a stateful API that provides a more powerful and flexible way to build AI applications, supporting features like multi-turn conversations, built-in tools (web search, file search, code interpreter), and background processing. It exposes the create model response operation (`POST /responses`).

### Key Features

- Stateful, multi-turn conversational model responses
- Built-in tools: web search, file search, and code interpreter
- Background processing for long-running requests
- Authentication via Azure API key (`api-key` header)

## Setup guide

To use the Azure OpenAI Responses Connector, you must have access to an Azure OpenAI resource through a [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com). If you do not have an Azure account, you can sign up for one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

### Create an Azure OpenAI resource and obtain the API key

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Search for "Azure OpenAI" in the top search bar and select **Azure OpenAI** from the results.

3. Click **Create** to create a new Azure OpenAI resource. Fill in the required details such as subscription, resource group, region, and resource name, then click **Review + create** and finally **Create**.

4. Once the resource is deployed, navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource.

5. In the left-hand menu, go to **Resource Management** -> **Keys and Endpoint**.

6. Copy one of the provided keys (Key 1 or Key 2) and the endpoint URL. Store them securely to use in your application.

### Derive the service URL

The Responses API is served from the `/openai/v1` base path, and the connector appends only the resource path (such as `/responses`) to the URL you supply. Append `openai/v1` to the endpoint copied from the portal to form the service URL:

```text
https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1
```

If the resource was created as an Azure AI Foundry resource, use its host instead:

```text
https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1
```

> **Note:** Passing the bare endpoint copied from the portal (`https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com`) sends requests to `/responses` rather than `/openai/v1/responses`, which fails with a `404`.

## Quickstart

To use the `Azure OpenAI Responses` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `ballerinax/azure.openai.responses` module. The `ballerina/io` module is also imported to print the response.

```ballerina
import ballerina/io;
import ballerinax/azure.openai.responses;
```

### Step 2: Create a new connector instance

Create a `responses:Client` with the API key and the service URL derived in the setup guide. The connector sends the key in the `api-key` header, which is the header Azure expects for API key authentication.

```ballerina
configurable string apiKey = ?;
configurable string serviceUrl = ?;

final responses:Client azureOpenAI = check new ({
    auth: {
        api\-key: apiKey
    }
}, serviceUrl);
```

Supply the values through a `Config.toml` file placed alongside the `Ballerina.toml` file:

```toml
apiKey = "<your-azure-openai-api-key>"
serviceUrl = "https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1"
```

> **Note:** An Azure OpenAI API key must not be passed as `token`. Azure accepts keys only in the `api-key` header, so sending a key as a bearer token fails with a `401`.

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, you can utilize available connector operations.

#### Create a model response

The generated text is carried by the `output` array of the response. Each output item holds a list of content parts, and the assistant's text is in the parts of type `output_text`.

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {

    responses:OpenAICreateResponse request = {
        model: "gpt-4o-mini",
        input: "What is the Ballerina programming language?"
    };

    responses:InlineResponse200 response = check azureOpenAI->/responses.post(request);

    foreach responses:OpenAIOutputItem item in response.output {
        anydata content = item["content"];
        if content !is anydata[] {
            continue;
        }
        foreach anydata part in content {
            if part is map<anydata> && part["type"] == "output_text" {
                io:println(part["text"]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** The `output_text` field on the response is a convenience property that the official OpenAI SDKs compute on the client side by joining the `output_text` content parts. The REST API does not send it, so it is nil on responses returned by this connector — read the text from `output` as shown above.

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```
